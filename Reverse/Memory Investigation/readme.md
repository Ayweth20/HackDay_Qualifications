**Description:**   
It's all about [execution](./challenge1.zip/).  
The flag is of the form HACKDAY{return}  

**Solution:**  
To solve this challenge you need to find the return value.  
So to find the flag, we need to understand how the program work.  
To test him we put the command `./challenge1.elf` then `./challenge1.elf FLAG`. The results are here :

Without *key* we received the "*Segmentation Fault*" message but with a *key* we have a good message.  
So to decompile and see the program code, we need to use **Ghidra** and find the good function who generate the flag (return).  
To find them, we use the "*Search* > *For Strings...* > *Search*" and write "*LUCK*" in the input to find the place :

With the decompile code (right part), we can see that's the *func2* function who generate the flag.  
So now we want to run the program with **gdb-peda** to break at the func2 and see the return value :
