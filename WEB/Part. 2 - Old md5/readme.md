**Solution:**  
To solve this challenge you need to find a way to control the server and find the flag.  
The vulnerability was found in the Part. 1 - Uploads so we need to find the password of a special user.  
To find the special user, we need to analyze the *passwd* file.  
(Image cat passwd)  
There is a (strange) user who can execute bash command : `shrek`
